# Design System Context

## Color Palette (Absolute Black & White)
- **Background**: Absolute Black (#000000).
- **Navbar**: Absolute Black (#000000) with glassmorphism/blur effects.
- **Text/Foreground**: Tech White (#ffffff).
- **Primary/Interactions**: Translucent Medium Grey (#6b7280 with opacity) / Steel.
- **Surface**: Dark Grey / Charcoal (#1a1a1a).

## Components & UI
- **Scrollbar**: Fixed Black background (#000000) for the track with a minimalist steel thumb.
- **Glassmorphism**: High-transparency grey overlays for buttons and active states.

## Principles
1. **High Contrast**: Pure white text on absolute black background for maximum precision.
2. **Minimalism**: Focus on core messaging and streamlined navigation.
3. **Elite Infrastructure**: Aesthetics suggesting high-end, dark-mode computing environments.
4. **Layout Precision**: All content and typography must be strictly left-aligned by default to maintain a structured, industrial appearance.
